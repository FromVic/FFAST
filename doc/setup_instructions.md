Refer to the [bill of materials](bill\ of\ materials.xlsx) for the complete list and websites the parts were sourced from in our project.

## Steps
1. Laser cut the acrylic plates with the [DXF files](dxf\ files/).
2. Manufacture the PCB with the [eagle and gerber files](RC\ car\ power\ distribution\ board/).
3. Setup the electrical connections according to the [circuit diagram](circuit_diagram.pdf).
4. Load the firmware into the VESC and calibrate its settings (instructions [here](vesc_setup.md)).
5. Assemble the car according to the 3D mechanical design of the vehicle from [here](FFAST_Assem.SLDASM).
6. [Install ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and all other [package dependencies](dependencies.md) on the Jetson TX2.(Please make sure the ROS verison installed to be kinetic, otherwise there might be some compatibility problems)
7. Set the udev rules on the Jetson (for the VESC, IMU and LIDAR) and the local computer (for the controller). Refer to the [rules file](99-usb-serial.rules) and use the same symbolic links, changing the values accordingly. (Joystick settings may vary due to different types of controllers, please check values)
8. Have a local computer with ROS and the same packages installed to remotely control the car.
9. Setup the network connections between the local computer and the car (instructions [here](remote_connection.md)).
10. The vehicle is now ready for [test runs](test_runs.md).
