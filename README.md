# FFAST

FFAST is a 1:10 scale vehicle testbed for testing dynamic motion planning and control algorithms in a (relatively) safe environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It has been developed for Linux, and no cross-compatibility effort has been made.

### Installing

Dependencies:

* Lightweight Communications and Marshalling [(LCM)](https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm)

* PODS [(PODS)](https://sourceforge.net/p/pods/home/Home/)
  * The build instructions fail to copy the pod and collection templates correctly. To fix it, manually copy the pods/_pods directory to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/_pods

Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/jsford/FFAST.git
```

## Running the tests

There are no automated tests at this point. Maybe some time waaaaay in the future there will be.

### Break down into end to end tests

## Deployment

If you want to use this for real, you will need to build yourself a car to test on. At some point, I will post details and schematics, but for now you're really out of luck. Email me!
